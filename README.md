# Computer Science Trivia 

I am using the (https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=18) Api to make a computer science themed trivia game. Players will be able to choose the level they want to play at and the amount of questions asked.

# MVP

- Use Axios to make a request to get back trivia questions to render on the dom.
- Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint (i.e. desktop, tablet, mobile, etc).
- Deployed site to a hosting service like Netlify.
 

# Post-MVP
